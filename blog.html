  <h2 id="how-the-war-started"> How the War Started</h2>
  <p>The 2025 Iran-Israel war is not a sudden spark, but a fire born of embers smoldering for decades.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">Historical Tensions:</span>The deep-seated tensions between Iran and Israel trace back to the 1979 Iranian
   Revolution, when Iran's new Islamic government adopted a fiercely anti-Israel stance, famously branding it the "Little Satan" to
    America's "Great Satan." This ideological opposition manifested in decades of proxy warfare, with Iran building what Israel calls 
	a "ring of fire" around its borders - funding and arming militant groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and various
	 Shiite militias in Syria and Iraq. Israel responded with a multi-pronged strategy of covert operations, including the 
	 assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists, sophisticated cyber attacks like the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran's nuclear
	  facilities, and preventive airstrikes on weapons convoys and infrastructure. The conflict remained largely in the shadows for
	   years, fought through third parties and deniable operations, even as both nations avoided direct military confrontation. This
	    prolonged cold war gradually drew in global powers, with Russia backing Iran's regional ambitions while the U.S. staunchly
		 supported Israel, creating a dangerous geopolitical fault line that finally erupted into open warfare in 2025 when Israel 
		 launched preemptive strikes on Iran's nuclear program. The current conflict represents the violent culmination of four 
		 decades of simmering hostility, with the potential to reshape the Middle East's balance of power for generations to come.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">Shadow Wars (2000–2020):</span>The shadow war between Iran and Israel reached its peak between 2000–2020 through covert operations that avoided direct 
  confrontation but deepened hostilities. Israel's Mossad was linked to the assassinations of at least five Iranian nuclear scientists
  , sabotaging Tehran's atomic ambitions while maintaining plausible deniability. Iran retaliated by expanding its proxy network,
   supplying Hezbollah with precision-guided missiles and Hamas with rocket technology to threaten Israel from multiple fronts.
    The cyber realm became a key battleground, most notably with Stuxnet—a U.S.-Israeli cyberweapon that destroyed Iranian 
	centrifuges—followed by Iranian hacking attacks on Israeli infrastructure. These clandestine strikes created an undeclared war
	 of attrition, with both sides testing red lines without triggering all-out conflict. Though largely hidden from public view,
	  these shadow wars eroded trust and set the stage for today's explosive military showdown.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Events Leading to War:</strong></p>

  <h2 id="whats-next"> What’s Next?</h2>
  <p><strong>Diplomatic Deadlock:</strong> The direct military confrontation between Iran and Israel has led to a diplomatic stalemate
  , with neither side willing to back down and international mediation efforts failing to produce a breakthrough. Below is an analysis of 
  the key obstacles to peace and the failed negotiation attempts.</p>
  <p><strong>U.S. Tensions:</strong>The Trump administration warns Iran against crossing nuclear red lines.
Military strikes are possible if Iran enriches uranium beyond 60% purity.
U.S. demands immediate halt to nuclear escalation, backing Israel’s stance.
Failure to comply risks direct American intervention, escalating the conflict.
</p>
  <p><strong>Long-Term Concern:</strong>If diplomacy fails, the Iran-Israel conflict risks spiraling into a prolonged regional war,
   drawing in Hezbollah, Hamas, and Gulf states. A multi-year conflict could destabilize global oil supplies, trigger refugee crises,
    and strain U.S.-China-Russia relations. Escalation might push Iran to accelerate its nuclear program, while Israel could launch
	 preemptive strikes on additional targets. The longer the war lasts, the higher the chance of direct superpower involvement, 
	 turning a bilateral clash into a global crisis.</p>

  <h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>This is not merely a clash between two states—it’s the boiling point of decades of hidden warfare. As the world holds its breath, the threat of a nuclear flashpoint looms large.</p>
